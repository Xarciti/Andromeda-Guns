## Welcome to the Andromeda Gun System Repository.

This contains info such as the update log for the system as well as the links to where you can obtain the model.

> DevForum post: https://devforum.roblox.com/t/open-source-r6-based-gun-system/2320207 --Most recent models

## EasyUpdater

EasyUpdater can be used to update your guns programs automatically incase of a major update to the main system instead of the module.

> Updater: https://github.com/Xarciti/Andromeda-Guns/blob/main/EasyUpdater.lua

> Server: https://github.com/Xarciti/Andromeda-Guns/blob/main/MostRecentSystem.lua

You can use the updater by running the program in the command bar.

- First make a script in workspace named "server" (Case Sensitive) and paste the "MostRecentSystem.lua" program into it

- Run the "EasyUpdater.lua" program in command bar

**FINISHED!**

## Extra

This gun system is mainly for R6 Avatars, but I am working on an R15 version.
There will be a separate DevForum post for that version, but for now we stick with R6 since it's easier to animate with.

### Thank you for using Andromeda Gun System!
